* config: v1 disabled by default. v1 support remains available until October via setting :option:`--allow-deprecated-v1-api`.
* config: Fixed stat inconsistency between xDS and ADS implementation. :ref:`update_failure <config_cluster_manager_cds>`  
  stat is incremented in case of network failure and :ref:`update_rejected <config_cluster_manager_cds>` stat is incremented 
  in case of schema/validation error.
* config: Added a stat :ref:`connected_state <management_server_stats>` that indicates current connected state of Envoy with 
  management server. 
* ext_authz: added support for configuring additional :ref:`authorization headers <envoy_api_field_config.filter.http.ext_authz.v2alpha.HttpService.authorization_headers_to_add>`
  to be sent from Envoy to the authorization service.
* fault: added support for fractional percentages in :ref:`FaultDelay <envoy_api_field_config.filter.fault.v2.FaultDelay.percentage>`
  and in :ref:`FaultAbort <envoy_api_field_config.filter.http.fault.v2.FaultAbort.percentage>`.
* grpc-json: added support for building HTTP response from
  `google.api.HttpBody <https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/httpbody.proto>`_.

  to HTTP health checker requests.
* http: added support for a :ref:`per-stream idle timeout
  <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.idle_timeout>`. This applies at both :ref:`connection manager
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.stream_idle_timeout>`
  and :ref:`per-route granularity <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.idle_timeout>`. The timeout
  defaults to 5 minutes; if you have other timeouts (e.g. connection idle timeout, upstream
  response per-retry) that are longer than this in duration, you may want to consider setting a
  non-default per-stream idle timeout.
* http: added upstream_rq_completed counter for :ref:`total requests completed <config_cluster_manager_cluster_stats_dynamic_http>` to dynamic HTTP counters.
* http: added downstream_rq_completed counter for :ref:`total requests completed <config_http_conn_man_stats>`, including on a :ref:`per-listener basis <config_http_conn_man_stats_per_listener>`.
* http: added generic :ref:`Upgrade support
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.upgrade_configs>`.
* http: better handling of HEAD requests. Now sending transfer-encoding: chunked rather than content-length: 0.
* http: fixed missing support for appending to predefined inline headers, e.g.
  *authorization*, in features that interact with request and response headers,
  e.g. :ref:`request_headers_to_add
  <envoy_api_field_route.Route.request_headers_to_add>`. For example, a
  request header *authorization: token1* will appear as *authorization:
  token1,token2*, after having :ref:`request_headers_to_add
  <envoy_api_field_route.Route.request_headers_to_add>` with *authorization:
  token2* applied.
* http: response filters not applied to early error paths such as http_parser generated 400s.

  dynamic table size of both: encoder and decoder.
* http: added support for removing request headers using :ref:`request_headers_to_remove
  <envoy_api_field_route.Route.request_headers_to_remove>`.
* http: added support for a :ref:`delayed close timeout<envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.delayed_close_timeout>` to mitigate race conditions when closing connections to downstream HTTP clients. The timeout defaults to 1 second.
* jwt-authn filter: add support for per route JWT requirements.
* listeners: added the ability to match :ref:`FilterChain <envoy_api_msg_listener.FilterChain>` using
  :ref:`destination_port <envoy_api_field_listener.FilterChainMatch.destination_port>` and

* network: introduced :ref:`sni_cluster <config_network_filters_sni_cluster>` network filter that forwards connections to the
  upstream cluster specified by the SNI value presented by the client during a TLS handshake.
* proxy_protocol: added support for HAProxy Proxy Protocol v2 (AF_INET/AF_INET6 only).
* ratelimit: added support for :repo:`api/envoy/service/ratelimit/v2/rls.proto`.
  Lyft's reference implementation of the `ratelimit <https://github.com/lyft/ratelimit>`_ service also supports the data-plane-api proto as of v1.1.0.
  Envoy can use either proto to send client requests to a ratelimit server with the use of the
  :ref:`use_data_plane_proto<envoy_api_field_config.ratelimit.v2.RateLimitServiceConfig.use_data_plane_proto>`
  boolean flag in the ratelimit configuration.
  Support for the legacy proto :repo:`source/common/ratelimit/ratelimit.proto` is deprecated and will be removed at the start of the 1.9.0 release cycle.

* thrift_proxy: introduced thrift routing, moved configuration to correct location
* thrift_proxy: introduced thrift configurable decoder filters
* tls: implemented :ref:`Secret Discovery Service <config_secret_discovery_service>`.
* tracing: added support for configuration of :ref:`tracing sampling
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.tracing>`.
* upstream: added configuration option to the subset load balancer to take locality weights into account when
  selecting a host from a subset.
* upstream: require opt-in to use the :ref:`x-envoy-orignal-dst-host <config_http_conn_man_headers_x-envoy-original-dst-host>` header

  See more on trace context propagation :ref:`here <arch_overview_tracing>`.
* transport sockets: added transport socket interface to allow custom implementations of transport
  sockets. A transport socket provides read and write logic with buffer encryption and decryption
  (if applicable). The existing TLS implementation has been refactored with the interface.
