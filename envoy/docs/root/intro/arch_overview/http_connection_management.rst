HTTP connection management
==========================

HTTP is such a critical component of modern service oriented architectures that Envoy implements a
large amount of HTTP specific functionality. Envoy has a built in network level filter called the
:ref:`HTTP connection manager <config_http_conn_man>`. This filter translates raw bytes into HTTP
level messages and events (e.g., headers received, body data received, trailers received, etc.). It
also handles functionality common to all HTTP connections and requests such as :ref:`access logging
<arch_overview_access_logs>`, :ref:`request ID generation and tracing <arch_overview_tracing>`,
:ref:`request/response header manipulation <config_http_conn_man_headers>`, :ref:`route table
<arch_overview_http_routing>` management, and :ref:`statistics <config_http_conn_man_stats>`.

HTTP connection manager :ref:`configuration <config_http_conn_man>`.

.. _arch_overview_http_protocols:

HTTP protocols
--------------

Envoy’s HTTP connection manager has native support for HTTP/1.1, WebSockets, and HTTP/2. It does not support
SPDY. Envoy’s HTTP support was designed to first and foremost be an HTTP/2 multiplexing proxy.
Internally, HTTP/2 terminology is used to describe system components. For example, an HTTP request
and response take place on a *stream*. A codec API is used to translate from different wire
protocols into a protocol agnostic form for streams, requests, responses, etc. In the case of
HTTP/1.1, the codec translates the serial/pipelining capabilities of the protocol into something
that looks like HTTP/2 to higher layers. This means that the majority of the code does not need to
understand whether a stream originated on an HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 connection.

HTTP header sanitizing
----------------------

The HTTP connection manager performs various :ref:`header sanitizing
<config_http_conn_man_header_sanitizing>` actions for security reasons.

Route table configuration
-------------------------

Each :ref:`HTTP connection manager filter <config_http_conn_man>` has an associated :ref:`route
table <arch_overview_http_routing>`. The route table can be specified in one of two ways:

* Statically.
* Dynamically via the :ref:`RDS API <config_http_conn_man_rds>`.

Retry plugin configuration
--------------------------

Normally during retries, hosts selected for retry attempts will be selected the same way the
initial request is selected. To modify this behavior retry plugins can be used, which fall into
two categories:

* :ref:`**Retry host predicate** <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RetryPolicy.retry_host_predicate>`.
  These can be used to "reject" a host, which will cause host selection to be reattempted. If one or
  more predicates have been configured, host selection will continue until either the host predicates
  accept the host or a configurable
  :ref:`max attempts <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RetryPolicy.host_selection_retry_max_attempts>`
  has been reached. Any number of these predicates can be specified, and the host will be rejected if
  any of the predicates reject the host.
* :ref:`**Retry priority** <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RetryPolicy.retry_priority>`. These can
  be used to adjust the priority load used when selecting a priority for a retry attempt. Only one such
  plugin may be specified.

These plugins can be combined to affect both host selection and priority load.

For example, to configure retries to prefer hosts that haven't been attempted already, the builtin
`envoy.retry_host_predicates.other_hosts` predicate can be used:

.. code-block:: yaml

  retry_policy:
    retry_host_predicate:
    - name: envoy.retry_host_predicates.previous_hosts
    host_selection_retry_max_attempts: 3

This will reject hosts previously attempted, retrying host selection a maximum of 3 times. The bound
on attempts is necessary in order to deal with scenarios in which finding an acceptable host is either
impossible (no hosts satisfy the predicate) or very unlikely (the only suitable host has a very low
relative weight).

To configure retries to attempt other priorities during retries, the built in
`envoy.retry_priority.other_priorities` can be used.

.. code-block:: yaml

  retry_policy:
    retry_priority:
      name: envoy.retry_priorities.previous_priorities
      config:
        update_frequency: 2

This will keep track of previously attempted priorities, and adjust the priority load such that other
priorites will be targeted in subsequent retry attempts. The `update_frequency` parameter decides how
often the priority load should be recalculated.

These plugins can be combined, which will exclude both previously attempted hosts as well as
previously attempted priorities.

.. code-block:: yaml

  retry_policy:
    retry_host_predicate:
    - name: envoy.retry_host_predicates.previous_hosts
    host_selection_retry_max_attempts: 3
    retry_priority:
      name: envoy.retry_priorities.previous_priorities
      config:
        update_frequency: 2

Envoy can be extended with custom retry plugins similar to how custom filters can be added.

Timeouts
--------

Various configurable timeouts apply to an HTTP connection and its constituent streams:

* Connection-level :ref:`idle timeout
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.idle_timeout>`:
  this applies to the idle period where no streams are active.
* Connection-level :ref:`drain timeout
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.drain_timeout>`:
  this spans between an Envoy originated GOAWAY and connection termination.
* Stream-level idle timeout: this applies to each individual stream. It may be configured at both
  the :ref:`connection manager
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.stream_idle_timeout>`
  and :ref:`per-route <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.idle_timeout>` granularity.
  Header/data/trailer events on the stream reset the idle timeout.
* Stream-level :ref:`per-route upstream timeout <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.timeout>`: this
  applies to the upstream response, i.e. a maximum bound on the time from the end of the downstream
  request until the end of the upstream response. This may also be specified at the :ref:`per-retry
  <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RetryPolicy.per_try_timeout>` granularity.
* Stream-level :ref:`per-route gRPC max timeout
  <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.max_grpc_timeout>`: this bounds the upstream timeout and allows
  the timeout to be overridden via the *grpc-timeout* request header.
