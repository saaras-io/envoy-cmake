 * where m is the weight range. We also explicitly check for the unweighted special case and use a

 * TODO(htuch): We use EDF at Google, but the EDF scheduler may be overkill if we don't want to
 * support large ranges of weights or arbitrary precision floating weights, we could construct an
 * explicit schedule, since m will be a small constant factor in O(m * n). This
 * could also be done on a thread aware LB, avoiding creating multiple EDF

 * they would in normal P2C, though they will get picked less and less often. In the future, we
 * can consider two alternate algorithms:
 * 1) Expand out all hosts by weight (using more memory) and do standard P2C.
 * 2) Use a weighted Maglev table, and perform P2C on two random hosts selected from the table.
 *    The benefit of the Maglev table is at the expense of resolution, memory usage is capped.
