Buffer
======

The buffer filter is used to stop filter iteration and wait for a fully buffered complete request.
This is useful in different situations including protecting some applications from having to deal
with partial requests and high network latency.

* :ref:`v1 API reference <config_http_filters_buffer_v1>`
* :ref:`v2 API reference <envoy_api_msg_config.filter.http.buffer.v2.Buffer>`

Per-Route Configuration
-----------------------

The buffer filter configuration can be overridden or disabled on a per-route basis by providing a
:ref:`BufferPerRoute <envoy_api_msg_config.filter.http.buffer.v2.BufferPerRoute>` configuration on
the virtual host, route, or weighted cluster.

Statistics
----------

The buffer filter outputs statistics in the *http.<stat_prefix>.buffer.* namespace. The :ref:`stat prefix
<envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.stat_prefix>` comes from the
owning HTTP connection manager.
